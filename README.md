# My Knowledge Repository

Welcome to my personal notes repository! This is where I document what I've learned, record useful resources, and track projects across various topics—from machine learning and data science to a broad range of other subjects. As I grow and expand my interests, this repository will evolve to include insights, tutorials, and experiments across many domains.

## Contents

- **Machine Learning & Data Science:**  
  Notes, code snippets, tutorials, and experiments related to ML models, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and more.
- **Programming & Software Development:**  
  Code examples, best practices, and explorations in various programming languages and frameworks.
- **General Topics:**  
  Thoughts, resources, and experiments on new and emerging fields that catch my interest.
