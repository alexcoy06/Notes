## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data cleaning and preprocessing ensure that your dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. These steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, detecting outliers, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and integrating data sources.

- **Missing Value Handling:** Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode; or remove missing entries altogether.  
- **Duplicate & Inconsistency Removal:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records and resolve data inconsistencies.  
- **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure variables are in the appropriate format (e.g., numeric, categorical) for analysis.  
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment:** Use statistical methods to detect anomalies and decide whether to cap, transform, or remove them.  
- **Scaling & Normalization:** Standardize or normalize data to ensure comparability across features.  
- **Feature Encoding:** Convert categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.  
- **Data Integration & Reduction:** Merge multiple data sources and apply dimensionality reduction techniques when necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves summarizing and visualizing data to uncover underlying patterns and potential issues. It provides the first look at the dataâ€™s structure, enabling informed decisions about further analyses and modeling strategies.

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute summary measures (mean, median, variance, percentiles) to understand central tendencies and dispersion.  
- **Visual Analysis:** Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to reveal underlying patterns and anomalies.  
- **Correlation & Association:** Analyze relationships between variables using correlation matrices and pair plots.  
- **Distribution & Trend Analysis:** Evaluate data distributions and detect trends or clusters to inform further analysis.  
- **Missing Data Exploration:** Visualize and quantify missingness to guide subsequent preprocessing decisions.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis applies quantitative techniques to interpret data, test hypotheses, and make inferences about relationships. This stage provides the mathematical foundation for validating assumptions and ensuring that conclusions are robust and reliable.

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Use tests such as t-tests, chi-square tests, or ANOVA to compare groups and validate assumptions.  
- **Regression Techniques:** Employ linear, logistic, or other regression methods to model relationships and predict outcomes.  
- **Confidence Intervals:** Calculate intervals to quantify the uncertainty around parameter estimates.  
- **Correlation & Association Measures:** Use statistical tests to determine the strength and significance of relationships between variables.  
- **Non-Parametric Methods:** Apply tests like Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis for data that do not meet normality assumptions.  
- **Time Series Analysis:** For temporal data, use techniques such as ARIMA or seasonal decomposition to understand trends and seasonality.
