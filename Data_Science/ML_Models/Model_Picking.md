# Practical Applications of ML & NLP Models by Complexity

## Predicting Continuous Numbers (Regression)

Regression models predict continuous outcomes such as prices or temperatures based on input features. Use simple models like Linear Regression for clear linear relationships, while complex models like Gradient Boosting or Deep Neural Networks capture non-linear and intricate patterns.

**Simple:**  

- Linear Regression: Straight-line fit.  
- Ridge Regression: Linear model with L2 regularization.  
- Lasso Regression: Linear model with L1 regularization.

**Advanced:**  

- Decision Tree Regression: Splits data into regions.  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVM-based approach with tolerance margins.  
- Random Forest Regression: Ensemble of trees for robust predictions.

**Complex:**  

- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): Sequential ensemble of weak learners.  
- LightGBM: Fast, efficient tree-based boosting.  
- CatBoost: Boosting model handling categorical features.  
- Deep Neural Network Regression: Multi-layer networks for non-linear patterns.

### Predicting Boolean Values (Binary Classification)

Binary classification models are used for problems with two possible outcomes, such as spam detection or disease diagnosis. Simpler models offer easier interpretation, while advanced methods provide higher accuracy for complex datasets.

**Simple:**  

- Logistic Regression: Estimates probabilities using the logistic function.  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on nearby instances.  
- Perceptron: Basic linear classifier.

**Advanced:**  

- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Maximizes the margin between classes.  
- Decision Tree Classifier: Splits features to classify outcomes.  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: Ensemble boosting focusing on misclassifications.

**Complex:**  

- Random Forest Classifier: Aggregates multiple trees for improved accuracy.  
- AdaBoost: Emphasizes correcting misclassified cases.  
- Neural Network Binary Classifier: Deep models for complex decision boundaries.

### Predicting Categorical Values (Multi-class Classification)

Multi-class classification models handle scenarios with more than two classes, such as identifying product categories or animal species. Choose simple models for straightforward tasks, while more complex models can effectively manage high-dimensional data and intricate patterns.

**Simple:**  

- Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax): Extension for multiple classes.  
- Naive Bayes Classifier: Applies Bayesâ€™ theorem with independence assumptions.  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Uses neighbors' majority vote.

**Advanced:**  

- Decision Tree Classifier: Partitions feature space for class assignments.  
- Multi-class SVM: Uses one-vs-all or one-vs-one strategies.  
- Bagging Classifiers: Combines models to reduce variance.

**Complex:**  

- Deep Neural Network Classifier: Multi-layer networks (e.g., CNNs for images).  
- Random Forest Classifier: Ensemble of trees for robust predictions.  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Optimized sequential ensembles.

### NLP Models

NLP models specialize in processing and understanding textual data for tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and summarization. Basic models such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression work well for simple text classification, while advanced models like transformers capture rich, contextual information for state-of-the-art performance.

**Simple:**  

- Naive Bayes for Text: Common with bag-of-words or TF-IDF features.  
- Logistic Regression on TF-IDF: Applies logistic model to TF-IDF features.  
- SVM with Text Kernels: Uses SVM for text classification.

**Advanced:**  

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/LSTMs: Capture sequential dependencies in text.  
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): Simplified RNNs for sequence data.  
- CNNs for Text: Extract local features from text.

**Complex:**  

- Transformer Models (e.g., BERT, GPT): Use self-attention for contextual embeddings.  
- RoBERTa: An optimized version of BERT.  
- T5: Converts NLP tasks into text-to-text problems.  
- XLNet: Autoregressive model capturing bidirectional context.
